# Kano OS Platform Essential

This repo only contains a debian package for the specific hardware platform
essentials required to boot. The `kano-platform-essential` package is the
topmost one that installs the bare minimum to use a platform (boot loaders,
kernels, etc). In debian terms, this is a metapackage that links other packages.
